    <div class="p2"><center><h3>What elements should I consider for designing my kitchen?
</h3></center>There are a lot of factors that you need to consider when you plan to design a new kitchen or remodel it. A kitchen is often the hub of the home, so it is very important to get it right, otherwise, it is heartbreaking. Kitchen remodelling needs more thought than picking a few colours and materials. There are many factors that you need to consider such as
</div><br>
    
    <div class="p3"><center><h3>How do I choose my Kitchen Budget?</h3></center> You need to decide on a maximum budget for the project and choose crucial elements such as flooring, kitchen cabinets and countertops before you select anything else. If you need to keep costs down, perhaps you can retain the current kitchen layout and replace the cabinet doors, fixtures and fittings. You also need to plan whether you’ll do the work yourself or need to hire a builder.

    <div class="p2"><center><h3>How do I choose my Kitchen Style?
</h3></center> Kitchen styles come in many varieties and you must have a strong idea about how you’d like your new kitchen to look. There are many fun and funky kitchens with bright colours but you need to design it based on the kitchen space available. If you’re still in need of inspiration you can find amazing ideas in Homify for the types of kitchens that appeal to you in order to get beautiful ideas. Think about what sort of kitchen would be appropriate for the style/age of your home.
    When it's time to choose the colours for your kitchen, make sure you first take a moment to think about the mission of the kitchen—if you are really looking for excitement or it is the room more for helping you find 
a sense of peace? If it is a modern kitchen, do you want it to be your space to invent and conduct experiments—or are you and your family looking for a room that appears to be a great spot for entertaining?

    <div class="p2"><center><h3>How do I choose the perfect kitchen flooring?</h3></center>Plush carpets work well for kitchen. Although they offer comfort and luxury, carpets are dust traps and have to be cleaned regularly. Stains can be difficult to remove and they are not durable as hardwood floors. If you choose to use hardwood flooring, be sure to invest in good quality area rugs as they can help to soften the look of the bedroom and add warmth. Tiles are another option, and work well in hot climate regions, as they help to keep the place cool. Vinyl and laminate flooring are also options worth considering for the kitchen.</div><br>

    <div class="p3"><center><h3>How do I furnish a small kitchen?</h3></center>If you have a small kitchen, you definitely need big ideas in order to make the best use of the small space. White is a colour which can make a small space look big. So, for a start, try to paint the kitchen walls white. Use light colours for furniture and cabinets because darker colours make it look shabby and small. Try to fit in all the kitchen items and appliances inside the cabinet. This will make it look cleaner and neater. Do not over-burden your kitchen.

    <div class="p2"><h4>Rustic Style kitchens:</h4>“Worn," "distressed" and "rough hewn" may not be the first words that come to mind when we think of kitchens. But today rustic kitchens rival the classic white kitchen in popularity — thanks to their timber, stone, brick, vintage appliances and fireplaces.
</div><br>
    <div class="p3"><h4>Contemporary  Style kitchens:</h4>Contemporary kitchens can be very sleek, but while a purely modern kitchen often celebrates structure and grid, a contemporary kitchen is often more playful in form and finishes, including elements of other styles and creating its own reflection of the times.
</div><br>
        <div class="p2"><h4>Cottage Style kitchens:</h4>Cozy, happy and unpretentious, a cottage kitchen harks back to simpler times and evokes a sense of easy, carefree living. Beadboard, soft colors, vintage hardware, wood floors and colorful accents and curtains will infuse your kitchen with cottage comfort.
</div><br>
    <div class="p3"><h4>Craftsman Style kitchens:</h4>Craftsman style arose in the early 20th century as a reaction to the mass-produced fussiness of the Victorian era. Its rich woods, built-ins, handcrafted tiles and well-made simplicity continue to charm us. 
</div>
        <div class="p2"><h4>Mediterranean Style kitchens:</h4>Flared hoods, hand-painted tile, warm wood cabinets, beamed ceilings and arched cooking alcoves are just some of the features that put Spanish revival kitchens on the most-wanted list.
